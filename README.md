# 2FA OTP Secret Extractor

This is a lightweight Python utility designed to securely extract OTP secrets from 2FA QR codes. It supports both standard TOTP QR codes and Google Authenticatorâ€™s export format. The tool operates fully offline and was built with a focus on privacy, control, and recoverability.

## Features

- Extract OTP secrets from:
  - Standard 2FA setup QR codes (`otpauth://totp?...`)
  - Google Authenticator export QR codes (`otpauth-migration://offline?...`)
- Completely offline processing (no API calls or cloud sync)
- Helpful for device loss scenarios or migrating 2FA to a trusted password manager

## Use Cases

- Backup OTP secrets in secure local storage
- Migrate OTP tokens to another device or authenticator app
- Recover account access when the original device is lost

## Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- `pyzbar`
- `Pillow`
- `protobuf`

Install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
Save your QR code as a qr.png file

Run the script:

For standard OTP QR codes:
python extract_standard_qr.py

For Google Authenticator export QR codes:
python decode_google_qr.py

The tool will display the extracted secret, issuer, and label.
